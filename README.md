## Troubleshooting
* **Q. I got a warning message.**\
`*Notice* task.json output is NOT supported on this version of BlitzMax`
* **A. This is not a problem.**\
BlitzMax Legacy and BlitzMax NG bmk versions lower than 3.39 do not create the output folder while compiling.
Your compiled binary files will be placed inside your source folder -- just like with MaxIDE -- instead of following the 'ouput' path you've manually set in `tasks.json`.\
Read more about Tasks [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks).
</br></br>
* **Q. I'm seeing the same item in the Auto Complete list twice.**\
Whenever I type something, for example `Print`; I'm seeing `Print` twice in the Auto Complete list.
* **A. This seems to be a rare bug.**\
Just open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Generate Documentations` to refresh the list.
</br></br>
* **Q. My problem is not listed here.**\
